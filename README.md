# Overview

This project is a mobile task management application designed to help users organize and track their daily activities efficiently. As a software engineer, my goal is to deepen my understanding of mobile development, Kotlin, and cloud integration by building a real-world productivity tool.

The app enables users to add, edit, and delete tasks, mark them as completed, and synchronize their data with a cloud database for access across devices. The project emphasizes clean architecture, modern Android development practices, and seamless user experience.

**Purpose:**
To further my learning in mobile app development, Kotlin programming, and cloud database integration by building a practical and useful application.
